# Simple Vocabulary App
This is a simple vocabulary app with CRUD functions plus authentication and authorization. Once the User is logged in he/she can create Vocabularies. On the dashboard the User can see all vocabularies and the owner. Only the owner of a specific vocabulary can delete or update the word. 
In this app i tried to use graphql and typescript in the backend. It worked surprisingly well. In the frontend I used ApolloClient. At the beginning I had some trouble but it is very . :satisfied:
